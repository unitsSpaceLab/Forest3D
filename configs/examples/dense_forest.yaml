# Dense Forest Configuration
# Use for closed-canopy forest simulation with high vegetation density

terrain:
  scale_factor: 1.0
  smooth_sigma: 0.5  # Less smoothing for varied terrain

density:
  tree: 200    # Dense tree coverage
  bush: 50     # Understory vegetation
  rock: 10     # Occasional rocks
  grass: 300   # Ground cover
  sand: 2      # Minimal sand
